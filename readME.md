# animeGAN

## 💡 Inspiration

As artificial intelligence continues to dominate the world, the possibilities of creation are endless. As I have been exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence I have been really focused toward real-world applications such as the music industry and general business industries. As a break and more of a fun divertion, I decided to integrate AI with one of my hobbies which is watching Anime! 

## 💻 What it does
- The project generates unique realistic anime faces

## 🔨 How we built it

1. Planning the idea and deciding the execution. 2. Bulding the application was the next step. As GANs are relatively the hardest artificial intelligence I had to use a lot of referencing of kaggle where I get the dataset from. I still did learn a lot about GANs and have a thorough understanding of the code (hence the comments). 

## 🧠 Challenges I ran into
Training THE GAN! Period. Training GANs are one of the most difficult tasks machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers find themselves in. 

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing an entire GAN IS AWESOME!

## 📖 What we learned

I got to learn all about the different parts of a GAN including the generator and the discriminator. I learned a lot about GANS and it was too much to explain in such a short paragraph.

## 🔜 What's next for _animeGAN_

Creating an APP! I really want to introduce the GAN model the the public, and showcase and let everyone (all my fellow weebs!) access it. The plan is to use a simple flask + django stack and implement the GAN model into that web framework.

## Try It OUT!
Hopefully coming soon in the form of a web application! :)
